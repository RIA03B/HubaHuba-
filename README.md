# HUBA HUBA!  

The idea of a personal stylist becomes much more accessible with us. 
We are the Gordon Ramsay of fashion. We tell you what works for you and how to make it work for you because people are different, and we do things differently for everyone to make them feel and look good.  

We put effort in for you, so forget about the questions that come to your mind: what do I wear?, I don't have anything to wear, and I don't have time. 
We are passionate about helping you grow.  

Our Project will provide an opportunity for individuals to request our service(personal styling service). This service will be an amount that any working human that receives minimum wage in our current time can afford.
There are multiple offers they can select from. After they select an offer they will proceed by filling out a form, which is information regarding that individual. Then they select a payment method and when the order is complete it will be sent to the stylist.
There will also be a message displayed for the user, which will thank them for their order and display the amount of time they would wait before receiving personal styles exclusive to them.   

## What is the goal of the project? 

Fashion is constantly evolving; it can be hard to keep up.
We know what it’s like to feel overwhelmed or discouraged as you try to find the right style for you with today's hectic lifestyle, which is why we want to be there for you to make the process easier.  

Style has become one of the primary ways in which people express their personality and in which they distinguish themselves from those around them.
Garments which may fit one person may not necessarily be equally suitable for someone else.  

Different people will need different styles and designs, something which will be an expression of their uniqueness and personality.
Whoever said “clothes make a man” had the right idea about how people perceive each other from the first look.
Whether you like it or not, a big part of the first impression that we make when you meet someone depends on how you look – which is basically how you’re dressed.
